# Fuck the Dealer - drinking game
This Python project is based on the popular drinking game. It's rules are the following*:

  - Someone starts off as the dealer.
  - People get two guesses to guess the value of the top card on the deck. After the first guess, the dealer tells them if the card is higher or lower than their first guess. The dealer is not allowed to lie!
  - Aces are low…
  - If the player guesses correctly on the first guess the dealer takes 4 drinks. If guessed right on the second guess the dealer takes 2 drinks.
  - Cards are then laid out on the table for people to see what’s left in the deck.
  - If the player is still wrong on their second guess the player has to drink the difference between their second guess and the value of the card. E.g. if the player guessed 5 and the card was a 2, they would take 3 drinks.
  - Once the dealer has beaten 3 people IN A ROW, the deck moves on clockwise to the next person.
